The Legend of GitHub as told by a wandering Student

This wandering student's alias is Robert Longfield.

The Legend was inspired by school work, repositories, and other legends of elder days.
I like books, trees, flowers, rain, clouds, rivers, mountains, birds, and bread.
I also pray ardently that God's will be done in all things. 
For creation is beautiful, and I wish the will of an all Good God to be done.
Instead of the will of myself. I pray for the grace to deny myself and follow my God.
